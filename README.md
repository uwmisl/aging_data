# aging_paper_data_cleaned

In this directory there are two subdirectories that contain the data and analyses used in the main and supplemental text. 

Important note- all code uses Python 2.7

"qpcr_analysis" contains the qPCR data collected and the script used to calculate half-life values from that data.

"sequencing_analysis" contains the processed sequencing data, scripts used to analyze that data, and the outputs of those scripts.
